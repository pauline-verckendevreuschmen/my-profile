	<h1>Hello, i'm Pauline ðŸ˜Š</h1>
		<img src="images/Profile.jpg" id="profile">
			<p> 
				I was born in France, in La Tronche next to Grenoble. I've lived there for 8 years until we moved to Paris with my family. A few years later we moved to my favourite city ever, Toulouse. And then, one year ago we moved to Strasbourg. I am now at ESSEC Business School in first year of Bachelor in Business and Administration.

	<h2>What I want to do in the Future ðŸ’­</h2>

	<h2>Hobbies ðŸŽ¿</h2>
		<p>
			I enjoy taking picutres and videos and editing them, I use After Effects, Final Cut Pro and Lightroom. I also like adding my face on pictures of celbrities (as shown by the pictures). I love skiing and hiking due to the fact that my parents are mountain people. I really like cooking as well.
